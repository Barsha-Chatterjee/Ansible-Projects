1. INSTALL ANSIBLE TO A SERVER (Ubuntu is used here)

>> Install pip command

          $ sudo apt install python3-pip -y

>>Install Ansible using pip

          $ python3 -m pip install --user ansible       (or)      $ sudo pip install ansible


2. SET UP PASSWORDLESS AUTHENTICATION FOR MANAGED NODES

>> Using Public Key (from managed node)

         $ ssh-copy-id -f "-o IdentityFile <PATH TO PEM FILE>" ubuntu@<INSTANCE-PUBLIC-IP>

>> Using Password (from managed node)

        ..Go to the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/60-cloudimg-settings.conf

        ..Update PasswordAuthentication yes

        ..Restart SSH -- sudo systemctl restart ssh

        ..Create password -- $ sudo password <username>

        ..Now from the ansible server --   $ ssh-copy-id Username@Public_IP

                                           It will prompt to enter password : enter the password previously created from managed node, now from next login it would be passwordless
