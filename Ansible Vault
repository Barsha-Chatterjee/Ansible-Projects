Ansible Vault: Its used to secure sensitive data like passwords, API tokens, encrypt a file etc., within the ansible playbooks/roles.

Create a random password for vault

    openssl rand -base64 2048 > <vault_file_name.pass>

Create a file with sensitive data and encrypt it

    ansible-vault create path/to/the/credentials.yml --vault-password-file <vault_file_name.pass>

(Note : If you don't want to create any random password then while encrypting file, don't use --vault-password file syntax)
